# Django Chat Application

Prototype of a chat application built using django rest framework 
that detects child groomers using ChatGPT to analyse incoming messages. 
Based on this chatapp: https://github.com/Madhur215/Django-ChatApp
Note: You will need to insert your own API keys in order for the code to run. The ChatGPT model being used in this code is no longer accessible via OpenAI's API.
